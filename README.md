Sample Application (Java)

The executable emulates the look and feel of the Example Application shown on the website.  The code contains a UDP receiver class for capturing Caller ID packets from the LAN.  It includes methods for parsing data from call records, displaying Caller ID on multiple lines in a Window, and storing call data. Two small SQLite databases are created in order to show examples of database commands for customer pop-ups and call logging.
